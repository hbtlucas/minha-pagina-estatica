                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>I’m 21 years old, born in Cuiabá, Mato Grosso, where I spent my childhood. I moved away at a young age and grew up in a small town called Primavera do Leste. I completed high school at the Federal Institute of Mato Grosso – PDL Campus, an incredible place where I met equally incredible people. I believe I inherited personality traits from everyone I got closer to during that time.</p>
                <p>From an early age, I was always interested in technology, naturally curious, and fascinated by virtual reality. My strongest connection to the online world came through a game called Minecraft, where I spent countless hours playing and having fun. I even created a few servers and had some contact with Java coding, though only at a basic level.</p>
                <p>I also enjoyed futuristic movies involving hacking, which inspired me to create a YouTube channel with pentest tutorials. On that channel, I shared videos teaching how to use free pentest tools, along with other related content.</p>
                <p>As I grew older, I developed a love for culture, art, and sports — which is how I discovered skateboarding. Around the age of 16, when I started skating, I also found a strong passion for audiovisual projects. That was when I began working on video editing and learning Adobe tools like After Effects and Photoshop.</p>
                <p>At 17, after finishing high school, I got my first job as a graphic designer at a print shop. My second job was as a video editor</p>
                <p>Even though I enjoyed the audiovisual field, the idea of diving into the world of programming never left my mind. At 19, I joined the Federal University of Rondonópolis (UFR) to study Information Systems, where I’m still a student. At 21, I passed a public exam and now, in addition to being a student, I also work as an information technology technician at the same university.</p>
                <p>My greatest passion is skateboarding — something I truly love. Recently, I’ve started exploring new hobbies: I'm a beginner in jiu-jitsu and have developed a strong interest in photography.</p>
                <p>I love music, and it’s always with me. I spend most of my time studying or working, but when I’m not busy with that, I go skateboarding — all of it while listening to music.</p>
                <p>I guess that's it. Despite everything, I’m still discovering myself.</p>
